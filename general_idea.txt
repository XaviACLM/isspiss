Hey, Claude. This is a file for you to read and figure out the main aims of the project.

The intent is not that you start work on this immediately - rather read this and reflect on what you think the appropiate way to tackle this problem will be - mainly what tecnologies to use and how to structure the project, particularly the backend. For anything where you don't see an obvious choice, you are more than welcome to bounce a few ideas off me through the terminal interface - just tell me what you think the options are and I'll help you choose. When this is finished, draft a file, project_structure.md, that will serve as a specification for the project - what technologies we'll be using and how everything will be structured. Create also CLAUDE.md to remind yourself of the existence of project_structure.md, and also feel free to give yourself whatever constraints and coding style guidelines you think are appropiate - of course I will review these files.

So, about the project:

This is a joke project - it came up as a silly idea while drinking and looking at open domain names. We intend to make the frontend, and possibly backend, of a website that will go on isspiss.com. It will tell us when astronauts are pissing. At the basic level, it will do little else.

So you might already have heard of this. NASA exposes a relatively extensive API for the ISS, which in particular lets one know how full the toilet's urine tank is. This appears to be of a fairly high time resolution, so watching this value for changes allows us to know when someone is taking a piss on the space station. The website will simply watch for this and display a message informing of the situation whenever an astronaut is pissing.

There are a few extra things.

- First of all, this should work both on desktop and mobile.

- Secondly, there will be some ads. I understand that it will be beyond your capabilities (simply as a matter of modality) to simply set these up, so it's fine to simply leave a "scaffolding" for them - like a "this is where the ads will go, but for now this is just a bunch of randomly sized rectangles". The ads are to pay for the domain name, but we think they actually make the website a little bit funier if there's like, a slighlty-past-distasteful amount of them - e.g. on desktop i'm imagining one full column of ads on either side of the webpage. I'm not sure what the equivalent of this would be on mobile. I also think it would be funny to have a small button towards one of the upper corners politely labeled "Excuse me, could I get some more ads?" that, upon clicking, briefly flashes a blank screen with "Sure thing!" and then completely litters the page with ads - I'm imagining everything important on the webpage gets a semi-opaque background to remain visible, and the website's entire background is saturated with advertisements. Again, I'm not sure how this would translate to a mobile experience.

- Thirdly, and this is where some decisions need to be made - where does the website get this data from? See, originally I was imagining the frontend just periodically polling some endpoint that tells us how full the piss tank is, and some js code runs the logic to detect piss events and that all works out easily. However, there's two problems with this:

	- There is really nothing as simple as a REST enddpoint at api.nasa.gov/iss/urine_level - rather it appears that the ISS telemetry is accessed via a streaming protocol (Lightstreamer) (in particular it streams all manner of ISS telemetry updates, from which we will have to filter out urine-related updates). I have never worked with anything like this, so I am fully clueless about what we'll need to set up to get it to work - and, in particular, whether it is possible to set up this logic entirely within the frontend.

	- And, even if we do manage to get it working on the frontend, there's some reasons to prefer having a minimal backend setup: (1) avoid having every different client repeatedly polling the same endpoint (does the streaming protocol situation mean that this isn't a real issue?), (2) allow us to keep some state to show some extra info, like "last pissing event", or "piss events per day", etc, and (3) cram in some extra technologies so that my cv can later say "yes man I'm totally familiar with cloudflare workers". But of course this is an important choice, since it will also be adding complexity (and forcing me to go through the steps to set up something with cloudflare/vercel/netlify/aws/etc) - we will need to make a decision here.

Generally as you see there are two big choices - we will probably need to talk about this before deciding on anything specific. For both choices, also, certain aspects need to be nailed down, e.g. for frontend-only "how will the lightstream business actually work", for minimal-backend "which minimal backend service do we actually use, how do we keep some minimal state, how do we manage client updating," etc.

- And lastly, about what the actual website's content looks like. I actually don't have many ideas here - I'm not a big UI guy. I'm imagining you just enter the website, and it is fairly minimal but with just enough information to understand (1) that this is a website that tells you when someone's pissing on the iss (no need to spell it out, frankly the url isspiss.com may already be enough information), (2) whether someone is pissing this very instant, (3) maybe some extra info, like when was the last time someone pissed. I'm also imagining the pissing alert being over-dramatic, like "PISSING!!!" in huge red letters with an alarm gif on either sie (sound? maybe?). I'm not married to that idea, though. Again, we'll need to sort this out by chatting through the terminal: try drafting a few of your ideas for what the website should look like and i'll guide us so we can dial in on a single choice.

Oh, and a note about what technologies to use: for frontend i'm familiar with react/ts/js, for backend only with fastAPI. These are by no means hard constraints, in fact I'll be surprised if fastAPI is even relevant. React may be a good choice but we're also fine with anything else that is relevant and might sound nice in the cv - I'm fine with using this project as an opportunity to learn one or several new technologies. As a matter of fact, if sensible, please use tailwind, since that seems to be something pretty useful that I've never gotten around to learning.

Okay, so that's all. Remember, your task now is to figure out the specifics of the project specification (overall design choices, technologies used, structure) - dialoguing with me for any nonobvious choice - and then go ahead to write project_structure.md and CLAUDE.md.
